A Sketch of A m erican H istory
Throughout its history, one coul say w ithout too m uch exaggeratbn,
Am erica has been taken for som ethng that i isn't and then accused of
fraud w hen its true nature has finally em erged.
J. M artin Evans
The tw o w orld w ars in the first half of the tw entieth century and the Cold W ar that ended
at the close of it all exhibited the enorm ous national strength of the United States. A s the
w orld enters the 2lst century, A m erica still occupies a predom inant position in the
intemational affairs. H ow ever, jst over tw o hundred years ago, the U nited S tates w as still a
rather w eak colony under the m ighty British Em pire. This chapter w ill trace the historical
grow h of he U nited States and exam ine how the country has developed into its present stage
w ith in such a short period of tim e.
This text is based on Jonathan Rose's w riting on Am erican history.
1. D iscovery and English Settlem ents (1492 -1607)
In he 15 th and 16th centuries, the European com m unity supported he invasion of
Am erica because of the passions -- greed, dream s of secular and spiritual em pire, the
com petition for national prestige and pow er. This w ill to trium ph w as backed up by superior
technology -- true ships, navigational aids, w ritten com m unication, explosives, and so on.
Besides, luxury item s like spices, perfum es, silk and chinaw are had for centuries been
transported a long distance through the M oslem -controlled M editerranean and distributed to
Italy. The rising European pow ers like Spain, France and Britain w ere determ ined to break
the m onopoly of com m erce by Italy. They tried to reach the Indies by sea.
In 1492 Christopher Colum bus, searching for a w estw ard sea route to India, landed in
the B aham a Islands and discovered A m erica. B etw een 1519 and 1522, Ferdinand M agellan's
expedition w ent all the w ay around the w orld for the first tim e. V asco da G am a reached
Calicut, India in 1498. M any European sailors claim ed to have found new land, but w riters
of the day usually gave the priority to an Italian, A m erigo V espucci (1451 - 1512). The
A m erican continent is nam ed after him . The first explorers touched chiefly on lands in the
Caribbean, but it soon becam e apparent that he New W orld represented an alm ost
unim aginably vast continental landm ass, the exact dim ension of w hich w ould not be
appreciated for another century.
B eginning w ith Colum bus Spanish em ployers, several European nations sought to create
in the N ew W orld great em pires m odeled on the m otherland. The first English venture to the
N orth A m erican continent w as undertaken by John Cabot Cabot w as an Italian explorer w ho
claim ed N ew foundland for his sponsor, K ing H enry V II in 1497. A fter decades of neglect.
English interest in the N ew W orld revived w ith the country's geopolitical contest w ith Spain.
In 1578, Elizabeth I granted Sir H um phrey G ibert a patent to colonize N orth A m erica
w hich provided that all colonists w ere to enjy the sam e rights and privileges as English
citizens at hom e.
2. The ColonialEra (1607 -1776)
This period lasts 169 years, beginning w ith the settlem ent of the Jam estow n colony and
ending w ith the signing of the D eclaration of Independence. C olonization efforts revived after
1603. under Jam es I, directed at several points from M aine southw ards. In 1606 Parliam ent
created the London and Plym outh V irginia Com panies to prom ote settlem ent, and the
follow ing year the London Com pany set up the first successful English colony at Jam estow n
in w hat is now southem V irginia.
The initial subtropical plantation to grow sugar cane, oranges, lem ons, alm onds and
aniseed proved to be unsuccessful It only changed for better in 1612 w hen local tobacco w as
developed. Sm oking w as w ell liked in England, and becam e the cash crop, the m oney of the
V irginia colbnies and later of M aryland and N orth C arolina. In 1616 private property began in
V irginia: settlers w ere granted 100 acres apiece to w ork. In 1619 m ilitary rule w as abolished
in V irginia, and the first legislative assem bly convened as H ouse of B urgesses.
In N ew England, the norheastem region of w hat is now the United States, several
settlem ents w ere established by English Puritans. These settlers believed that the Church of
England had adopted too m any practices from Rom an Catholicism , and they cam e to A m erica
to escape persecution in England and to found a colony based on their ow n religious ideals
One group of Puritans, called the "Pilgrim s," crossed the A tlantic in the ship M ayflow er and
settled at Plym outh, M assachusetts in 1620. Finding them selves beyond the authority of
V irginia, the colonists devised for them selves a com pact -- M ayflow er Com pact, providing
for m ajprity rule and self-govemm ent, signed by 4l adult m ales. Its significance lies in that
this govemm ent depended on the consent of the affected individuals: and it served as a
prototype for sim ilar com pacts in A m erican history -- to live under the rule of law , based on
the consent of the people. A m uch larger Puritan colony w as established in the Boston area in
1130
N either the Jam estow n nor the Plym outh colonies show ed any signs of vigorous life until
their settlers w ere allow ed to ow n land and to w ork for their ow n profit rather than for the
com m on or com pany good. O nce this happened, both New England and V irginia becam e,
literally, lands of opportunity for the English m iddle and w orking classes.
In England, and in Europe generally, land w as scarce and expensive. Labor w as
abundant and cheap, w ith a considerable unem ploym ent In N orth A m erica, the situation w as
reversed. So it acted as a m agnet, attracting those w ho had skills, w anted to w ork, and
hoped to get som e land and other property they could ow n. The London Com pany paid for
their transportation to V irginia, w ho agreed to w ork for the com pany for7 years. D uring this
century m ost indentured servants cam e from England. They signed contracts before sailing.
Skilled w orkers rarely had to indenture them selves for m ore han 3 years. M ost others agreed
to 4 - 5 years. A bout 1 500 - 2 000 arrived in V irginia each year. By 1634, V irginia's
population w as approaching five thousand, forty thousand by the 1670s.
M ost A m erican colonists w orked on sm all farm s. In the southem colonies of V irginia,
N orth Carolina and South Carolina, landow ners carved large tobacco and rice plantations out
of fertile river basins. These plantations w ere w orked by blacks under the system of slavery.
By 1733, English settlers had occupied 13 colonies along the A tlantic coast, from N ew
H am pshire in the north to G eorgia in the south. The French controlled C anada and Louisiana,
w hich included the entire M ississippi w atershed -- a vast em pire w ith few people. Betw een
1689 and 1815, France and Britain fought several w ars, and N orth A m erica w as draw n into
every one of them . By 1756, England and France w ere fighting the Seven Y ears W ar,
know n in A m erica as the French and Indian W ar. Britain w on the w ar in 1763 and controlled
all of N orth A m erica Hudson Bay to the Florida K eys, from the A tlantic to the M ississippi
W hen the British tried to m ake its A m erican colonies absorb the costs of driving out the
French and sought to regulate he behavior of its A m erican subjects, it m et w ith resistance.
To prevent fighting w ith the N ative A m ericans, know n as Indians to the Europeans, a royal
proclam ation denied colonists the right to settle w est of the A ppalachian M ountains. The
British govemm ent began punishing sm ugglers and charged new taxes on sugar, coffee,
textiles and other im ported goods. The Q uartering A ct forced the colonies to house and feed
British soldiers; and w ith the passage of the Stam p A ct, special tax stam ps had to be attached
to all new spapers, pam phlets, legal docum ents and licenses.
The colonists w ho w ere used to a tradition of self-govemm ent insisted that they could be
taxed only by their ow n colonial assem blies. "No taxation w ithout representation" w as their
rallying cry. In 1765, representatives from nine colonies m et as the "Stam p A ct Congress'
and spoke out against the new tax. M erchants refused to sell British goods and m ost colonists
sim ply refused to use the stam ps. The British Parliam ent w as forced to repeal the S tam p A ct.
but it enforced the Q uartering A ct, enacted taxes on tea and other goods and sent custom s
officers to Boston to collect those tariffs. A gain he colonists refused to obey, so British
so ldiers w ere sent to B oston.
Tensions eased w hen Lord Norh, the new British Chancelor of the Exchequer,
rem oved all the new taxes except that on tea. In 1773, a group of patriots responded to the
tea tax by staging "Boston Tea Party" : D isguised as Indians, they boarded British m erchant
ships and tossed 342 crates of tea into B oston harbor. Parliam ent then passed the " Intolerable
A cts" and closed the port of Boston. In Septem ber 1774, the First C ontinental Congress, a
m eeting of colonial leaders from all colonies except G eorgia opposed to w hat they perceived
to be British oppression in the colonies, m et in Philadelphia. These leaders urged A m ericans
to disobey the Intolerable A cts and to boycott British trade. The m ilitary conflict w as around
he comer
3. The Am erican Revolution (1775 -1783)
O n A pril 19, 1775, the British soldiers confronted the colonists at Lexington, w hich
m arked the beginning of the Revolutionary W ar. In M ay 1775, a second Continental
Congress m et in Philadelphia and began to assum e the function of a national govemm ent It
founded Continental am y and navy under the com m and of G eorge W ashington. It printed
m oney and opened diplom atic relations w ith foreign pow ers. In 1776 Thom as Paine published
Com m on Sense, saying that an island should not govem a country. It sold 100 000 -- 120 000
copies in three m onths, greatly influenced colonial opinion tow ard independence
0 n July 4, 1776 The D eclaration of Independence w as approved by the Congress, but
not signed until A ugust ( see Supplem entary Reading 1). It w as drafted by Thom as Jefferson
of V irginia and edited by a num ber of people from different states.
The m ilitary struggle against the m other country ended form ally in 1783 and w as
successful The Treaty of Paris w as signed and the British govemm ent recognized the
independence of the U nited States and granted the new nation all the territory norh of
Florida, south of Canada and east of the M ississippi R iver.
4.The Constitution and the B ill ofR ights
The 13 colonies w ere now " free and independent states" -- but not yet one united
nation. Since 1781, they had been govemed by the A rticles of Confederation, a constitution
that set up a very w eak central govemm ent In M ay, a convention m et in Philadelphia w ith
instructions to revise the A rticles of Confederation. The delegates drafted a new and m ore
w orkable Constitution. It established a stronger federal govemm ent em pow ered to collect
taxes, conduct diplom acy, m aintain arm ed forces, and regulate foreign trade and com m erce
am ong the states. It provided for a Suprem e Court and lesser federal courts, and it gave
executive pow er to an elected president M ost im portantly, it established the principle of a
"balance of pow er" to be m aintained am ong the three branches of govemm ent - the
executive, the legislative and the judicial U nder this principle, each branch w as provided the
independent m eans to exercise checks on and to balance the activities of he others, thus
guaranteeing that no branch could exert dictatorial authority over the w orkings of the
govemm ent
The Constitution w as accepted in 1788, but only after m uch bitter debate. M any
A m ericans feared that a pow erful central govemm ent w ould tram ple on he liberties of the
people, and in 1791 ten am endm ents -- the B ill of R ights - w ere added to the Constitution.
The C onstitution and the B ill of R ights thus struck a balance betw een tw o conflicting but
fundam ental aspects of A m erican politics --- the need for a strong, efficient central authority
and the need to ensure individual liberties. A m erica' s first tw o political parties divided along
those ideological lines. The Federalists favoured a strong president and central govemm ent:
the R epublicans defended the rights of the individual states, because this seem ed to guarantee
m ore " local" control and accountability. The Republican party appealed to sm all fam ers;
the Federalist party w as the party of the prosperous classes, and it w ould die out by 1820.
5. Nation Building
In 1789 G eorge W ashington took he oath of office as the first President of the U nited
States of A m erica in New Y ork C ity. The A m erican Constitution tumed into a functioning
govemm ent. D uring his presidency, A lexander H am ilton and Thom as Jefferson form ed
political parties - the Federalists and the R epublicans, around their respective interests and
positions. In 1797, John A dam s, a Federalist, becam e the second President He becam e
involved in an undeclared naval w ar w ith France. In an atm osphere of w ar hysteria, the
Federalist-controlled Congress passed the A lien and Sedition A cts in 1798. These m easures
pem itted the deportation or arrest of " dangerous" aliens, and they prescribed fines or
im prisonm ent for publishing " false, scandalous, and m alicious" attacks on the govemm ent
T en R epublican editors w ere convicted under the Sedition A ct, w hich w as bitterly denounced
by Thom as Jefferson.
The repression w hich occurred under the A lien and Sedition A cts ended in 1801, w hen
Thom as Jefferson w as elected president. A s a Republican, Jefferson w as an inform al.
accessible chief executive. A lthough he w anted to lim it the pow er of the president, political
realities forced Jefferson to exercise that pow er vigorously. In 1803, he bought the huge
Louisiana territory from France for $15 m illion. N ow the U ntied States w ould extend as far
w est as the R ocky M ountains.
D uring the N apoleonic W ars, British and French w arships harassed A m erican m erchant
ships. Jefferson responded by banning Am erican exports to Europe, but New England
m erchants protested that their trade w as ruined by the em bargo, w hich Congress repealed in
1809. In 1812, how ever, President Jam es M adison w ent to w ar w ith Britain over this issue.
D uring the W ar of 1812, A m erican w arships had som e im pressive victories, but the
vastly superior British N avy blockaded A m erican ports. A ttem pts to invade British Canada
ended in disaster. and British forces captured and bumed W ashington. the nation's new
capital city. Britain and the United States agreed on a com prom ise peace in D ecem ber 1814 :
neither side w on any concessions from the other. Tw o w eeks later, G eneral A ndrew Jackson
routed a British assault on N ew O rleans. N ew s of the peace treaty had not yet reached the
So ld iers.
A fter the w ar, the United States enbyed a period of rapid econom ic expansion. A
national netw ork of roads and canals w as built, steam boats traveled the rivers, and the first
steam railroad opened in Baltim ore, M aryland, in 1830. The Industrial Revolution had
reached A m erica. There w ere textile m ills in N ew England: iron foundries in Pennsylvania.
By the 1850s, factories w ere producing rubber goods, sew ing m achines, shoes, clothing,
fam im plem ents, guns and clocks.
The frontier of settlem ent w as pushed w est to the M ississippi R iver and beyond. In
1828. A ndrew Jackson becam e the first m an bom into a poor fam ily and bom in the W est,
aw ay from the cultural traditions of the A tlantic seaboard, to be elected president Jackson
and his new D em ocratic party, heirs to the Jeffersonian Republicans, prom oted a creed of
popular dem ocracy and appealed to the hum ble m em bers of society -- the fam ers, m echanics
and labourers. Jackson rew arded the inexperienced but loyal supporters w ith govemm ent
pbs. He m ade land available to w estem settlers m ainly by forcing Indian tribes to m ove w est
of the M ississippi
The rapid territorial expansion w as accom panied by grow ing tensions and injustices.
Slavery becam e the distinctive badge that dem arcated tw o rivalregions. A s the norhem states
industrialized, they also becam e far m ore urbanized than the South, and w ere m ore likely to
attract im m igrants that gave them a far greater ethnic and social diversity. Econom ic schism
led to political conflict. Anxious to prom ote dom estic m anufactures, the northem states
generally favoured high tariffs to deter foreign and especially B ritish industrial im ports. This
w as anathem a to the southem cotton lords, w ho depended on British m ills as their chief
m arket and benefited from the im portation of cheap food and finished goods.
6. The SectionalConflict and the C ivilW ar
In the South, how ever, due to the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, a m assive new
dem and for raw cotton w as created hence the problem is how to grow and pick the necessary
cotton w hen production w as so intensive in both labor and land. The solution w as found in a
greater com m ercial use of plantation slavery, the harshest and least reputable fom of an
already tainted enterprise. In 1860 the 4. 5 m illion A frican A m ericans constituted alm ost a
seventh of the total Us population, and 4 m illion of these rem ained slaves.
The years from 1848 to 1860 are know n as the pre-w ar period, w ith irrepressible conflict
that pervaded political life. The new territorial gains in the w est as a result of the M exican
A m erican w ar affected the stability of the regional balance, w hich w as intended by the
M issouri Com prom ise that provided a clearly defined northem boundary for he institution of
slavery.
A nti-slavery sentim ent grew at the end of he 18 th century, and m ost northem states
abolished the institution. The slave trade officially perished in 1808. The free black
com m unities of the N orth developed a rem arkable solidarity and self-confidence, and an
institutional netw ork based on their distinctive churches, m utual aid groups and fratemal
lodges. M any incidents took place w here norhem crow ds physically interfered to save
fugitives from the hands of slave catchers, or even US officials. O utrage w as further stirred
in 1852 by H arriet Beecher S tow e's novel U ncle Tom's Cabin, w hich depicted the brutalities
of slavery and indicated the m oral necessity to resist federal law in this area. The issue of
slavery becam e, in A m erican politics, econom ics and cultural life, the central point of
conten tion.
The debate and conflict developed into violence and riots. Legal struggles w ere also as
fierce over the issues of future slavery, such as the status of Dred Scott. The result of the
case w as that the Suprem e Court denied his claim to freedom , argued that Congress had no
right to regulate or forbid slavery , and dism issed blacks as a degraded race.
In 1859, the tension betw een N orth and South w as extrem e. John Brow n, an abolitionist
zealot, had tried to begin a slave rebellion in V irginia by attacking an arm y m unitions depot
Brow n w as quickly captured, tried and hanged, w hereupon m any N orthemers hailed him as a
m artyr. Southem w hites, how ever, now believed that the N orth w as preparing to end slavery
by bloody w arfare.
In the election of 1860, every Southem state voted against A braham L incoln, but the
N orh supported L incoln and he becam e the 16 th presidentof the country. A few w eeks later.
South Carolina voted to leave the Union. It w as soon bined by M ississippi, Florida,
A labam a, G eorgia, Louisiana, Texas, V irginia, A rkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina.
These ll states proclaim ed them selves an independent nation -- the Confederate States of
A m erica -- and the A m erican C ivil W ar began.
0 n A pril12, 1861, confederate cannon opened fire on Fort Sum ter in C harleston, South
Carolina. President L incoln considered it an act of w ar against the A m erican govemm ent
W ithin a few days he ordered troops to blockade the South.
L incoln's first priority w as to keep the United States one country: freedom for black
people w as a secondary objective. But L incoln realized that by m aking the w ar a battle
against slavery he could w in support for the Union at hom e and abroad. Accordingly, on
January 1, 1863, he issued the Em ancipation Proclam ation, w hich granted freedom to all
slaves in areas still controlled by the C onfederacy (see Supplem entary Reading 2).
The w ar lasted four years and ended w hen the Southem arm y under Robert E. Lee,
fom ally laid dow n its am s in surrender on A pril 2, 1865. 0 n A pril 14, L incoln w as
assassinated by he actor John w ikes Booth, a sym pathizer w ith he Southem cause. The
m ost obvious consequence of the w ar w as the enorm ous loss of hum an life, around 635 000.
M aterial destruction w as also huge, especially in the South. The destruction of industrial
plant and railw ay virtually undid m uch of the progress of the antebellum years, and state
finances w ere in chaos. Though the North also suffered m aterially, the political outcom e
ensured it w ould also achieve long-term benefits.
The w ar resolved tw o fundam ental questions that had divided the United States since
1776. It put an end to slavery, w hich w as com pletely abolished by the 13 th A m endm ent to
the C onstitution in 1865. It also decided, once for all, that A m erica w as not a collection of
sem i-independent states, but a single indiv isible nation.
7. Reconstruction (1865 -1877)
W ith the end of the C ivil W ar. the U nited States faced unprecedented questions about
the status of the territories that had been in rebellion. In 1865, the 13 th A m endm ent w as
ratified to abolish slavery. Y et it could not ensure equality. L egislatures in the South refused
to allow blacks to vote and they enacted " black codes" to restrict the freedom of form er
slaves. The m ost notorious organization to em erge w as the Ku K lux K lan, a Confederate
veterans' m ovem ent that originated in Tennessee during 1866 and rapidly acquired the status
of a vast and lethal political m ovem ent across the entire South. By 1872 the federal
govemm ent had suppressed the K lan, but w hite D em ocrats continued to use violence and fear
to regain control of their state govemm ents. Reconstruction cam e to an end at the end of
1877. w hen new constitutions had been ratified in all Southem states and all federal troops
w ere w ithdraw n from the South.
D espite constitutional guarantees, Southem blacks w ere now" second-class citizens"
that is, they w ere subordinated to w hites, though they still had lim ited civil rights. Tow ard
the end of the century, a rigid system of segregation and oppression of blacks w as
established. In the 1896 case of P lessy v. F erguson, the U nited States Suprem e C ourt ruled
that the Constitution perm itted separate facilities and services for the tw o races, so long as
these facilities and services w ere equal Southem state legislatures prom ptly set aside
separate -- but unequal --- facilities for blacks. Law s enforced strict segregation in public
transportation, theatres, sports, and even elevators and cem eteries. M ost blacks lost the right
to vote because of their inability to pay the poll taxes and their failure to pass literacy tests.
A lthough blacks w ere legally free after the w ar, as a result of poverty and ignorance, m ost
Southem blacks continued to w ork as tenant farm ers and still lived and w ere treated very
m uch like slaves.
8. Industrialization and O verseas E xpansion
D uring the last quarter of the 19 th century, the U nited States w as becom ing the w orld's
leading industrial pow er, and great fortunes w ere m ade by shrew d businessm en. Several
different industries - the production of coal, steel, iron, copper and oil - illustrated w hat
Andrew Camegie w rote in 1886: " The old nations of he earth creep on at a snail s pace.
The R epublic thunders past w ith the speed of an express. " To encourage the expansion of the
railroad, the federal govemm ent granted loans and free land to w estem railroads. B y 1900,
the railw ays represented about a tenth of the total w ealth of the U nited States.
Industrial grow th gave the chance for a fundam ental restructuring of business in the
direction of ever-larger corporation, soon to becom e giant cartels and m onopolies. To lim it
the pow er of the trusts, and protect the rights of the individual, the Sherm an A ntitrust A ct
banned trusts, m ergers and business agreem ents in 1890, w hich established he principle that
the federal govemm ent could regulate industry for the com m on good.
Tow ard the end of the 19 th century, the U nited S tates becam e the w orld's m ost pow erful
country and it began to look outw ard for m ore m aterials and m arkets. In 1898, the U nited
States w as involved in an im perialist w ar w ith Spain (see Supplem entary Reading 3). The
w ar ended quickly and the United States acquired m uch of Spain's em pire -- Cuba, the
Philippines, Puerto R ico and G uam . In 1903, A m erica also seized a strip of land in w hat is
now Panam a from the Colom bian govemm ent and built the Panam a Canal.
9. The Progressive M ovem ent and W orld W ar I
w hile A m ericans w ere venturing abroad, they w ere also taking a fresh look at social
problem s at hom e. A lthough the econom y w as boom ing and prosperity w as spreading, up to
half of all industrial w orkers still lived in poverty  and m any of those w orkers w ere w om en
and children. B efore 1900, the prevailing econom ic dogm a had been laissez-faire -- the idea
that govemm ent should interfere w ith business as little as possible. A fter 1900. the
fashionable ideology w as " Progressivism " -- a m ovem ent to refom society and individuals
through govemm ent action.
Popular books including Jack London's The Iron H eel represented he fears that shaped
the thinking of the social reform ers know n as Progressives, w hose m otivations chiefly
concemed about the horrors and injustices they w itnessed around them , as w ell as a clear
sense that social refom in the present m ight be the only m eans of averting tum oil or even
civil w ar in another decade or tw o. The investigative pumalists called "m uckrakers" exposed
abuses that required attention, for exam ple in accounts of slum conditions, shady business
practices, and m unicipal corruption.
President Theodore Roosevelt strengthened federal regulation of the railroads and
enforced the Sherm an A ntitrust A ct against several large corporations, including the Standard
0 il Com pany. Conservation w as prom oted - vast reserves of forests, coal, oil, m inerals
and w ater w ere saved for future generations.
W oodrow W ilson elected to the presidency in 1912 enacted a personal incom e tax, and
toughened antitrust law s against huge corporate m ergers and created the Federal Trade
Com m ission to police unfair business com petition. In 1913 the Federal R eserve A ct created a
govemm ent-controlled system of 12 regional reserve regulation of the nation's credit
W hen the First W orld W ar broke out in 1914, W ilson urged a foreign policy of strict
neutrality. How ever, over the next three years, pressure to enter the w ar becam e
unavoidable, largely because of the G erm an cam paign of subm arine w arfare against England.
The sinking of he British liner Lusitania, killing 128 Am erican passengers caused a
deterioration of G em an-Am erican relations. W hen A m erica realised that G em any w as
conspiring w ith M exico and Japan to recover the lands M exico had lost to the United States in
1848, President W ilson declared w ar on G erm any in A pril 1917.
w ilson outlined his w ar aim s -- the Fourteen Points. These called for, am ong other
things, open diplom acy, freedom of the seas, free intemational trade, disam am ent, free
settlem ent of colonial disputes. The m ap of Europe w ould be redraw n to establish
independent states for every national group, and a w orld association of nations w ould be
organized to protect the peace. 0 n N ovem ber11, 1918, an arm istice w as signed and brought
the First w orld w ar to an end.
In 1919, the V ersailles Treaty w as signed in France, in which the A llies im posed
crushing reparations on G erm any and divided its colonies am ong them selves. The treaty also
created the League of Nations, but the A m erican Congress feared that such a w orld
organization m ight drag the United States into another foreign w ar. Finally, the Congress
refused to ratify he Treaty of V ersailles and A m erica did not jbin the League of Nations.
10. The 1920 s and the G reat D epression
The m aprity of A m ericans grew disillusioned w ith the results of he First W orld W ar.
A fter 1920, the U nited S tates tumed inw ard and w ithdrew from European affairs.
D uring the 1920s, A m ericans w ere grow ing increasingly suspicious of and hostile tow ard
foreigners. The K u K lux K lan w as revived in 1915 and attracted m illions of follow ers and
terrorized blacks, C atholics, Jew s and im m igrants.
Another significant change during this period w as the restriction of im m igration to
A m erica. In 1921. Congress had enacted im m igration lim its. w hich w ere tightened in 1924
and again in 1929. These restrictions favored im m igrants from Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia
and G erm any. Sm all quotas w ere reserved for eastem and southem Europeans; none at all for
A sias.
The 1920s w ere also a tim e of conflict over changing m oral codes and the values of an
increasingly urban society. In 1920 the N ineteen th A m endm ent, w hich guaranteed w om en the
right to vote, w as adopted. This w as also the age of Prohibition. In 1920, alcoholic
beverages w ere outlaw ed by a constitutional am endm ent But drinkers cheerfully evaded the
law in thousands of " speakeasies", and gangsters m ade fortunes supplying illegal liquor.
For business, the 1920s w ere golden years of prosperity. The A m erican share of
intemational trade grew to 15 per cent in the early 1920s. The econom ic conditions betw een
1923 and 1928 w ere good in general, and far m ore consum ers w ere able to acquire w hat had
once been luxury goods, including cars, telephones and dom estic labour-saving devices. O ne
of the m ost adm ired m en of the decade w as Henry Ford, w ho had introduced the assem bly
line into autom obile production. Ford w as able to pay high w ages and still eam enorm ous
profits by m anufacturing the M odel T.
H ow ever, there w ere fatal flaw s in the prosperity of the 1920s. 0 verproduction of crops
depressed food prices, and fam ers suffered. Industrial w orkers w ere eaming better w ages,
but they still did not have enough purchasing pow er to continue buying the flood of goods that
poured outof their factories. W ith profits soaring and interestrates low , plenty of m oney w as
available for investm ent, but m uch of that capital w ent into reckless speculation. M any
investors bought stocks "on m argin," borrow ing m oney from their brokers to cover up to 90
percent of the purchase price. A s long as the m arket prospered, speculators could m ake
fortunes ovemight, but they could be ruined just as quickly if stock prices fell. The bubble of
this fragile prosperity finally burst in 1929, and by 1932 A m erican w ere confronting the w orst
econom ic crisis of m odem tim es.
1l. The Great D epression and the New D eal
In 1929, the stock m arket began to collapse, and the B ank of U nited States in N ew Y ork
closed. A s the G reatD epression set in, unem ploym ent rate rose to 9 per cent in 1930 and had
reached alm ost 24 by 1932. In the 1932 election D em ocrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, w hc
prom ised " a N ew D eal for the A m erican people" becam e the 32nd President.
" The only thing w e have to fear is fear itself," Roosevelt stated at his inauguration, and
he took prom pt action to deal w ith the em ergency (see Supplem entary Reading 4). w ithin
the first hundred days of his adm inistration, Roosevelt had rushed through Congress a great
num ber of law s to aid the recovery of the econom y. The C ivilian Conservation Corps (CcC )
put young m en to w ork in reforestation and flood control projects. The Federal Em ergency
Relief A dm inistration (FERA ) aided state and local relief funds, w hich had been exhausted
by the Depression. The A gricultural A djustm ent A dm inistration (A A A ) paid farm ers to
reduce production, thus raising crop prices. The Tennessee V alley A uthority (TV A ) built a
netw ork of dam s in the T ennessee R iver area, in the southeastem region of the United S tates,
to generate electricity, control floods and m anufacture fertilizer. A nd the N ational Recovery
A dm inistration( NRA ) regulated" fair com petition " am ong businesses and ensured
bargaining rights and m in im um  w ages for w orkers.
In 1935, the Social Security A ct established old-age and survivors pensions, as w ell as a
jbint federal-state program of unem ploym ent insurance. The W agner Labor Relations A ct
banned unfair em ployer practices and protected the w orkers' right to collective bargaining.
D uring the depression R oosevelt also started his " fireside chats" and explained in radic
broadcast w hat he w as doing w ith banking system , a friendly and m asterfulone. B y 1936 the
New Deal had done tw o m ain things -- restored the confidence of the m iddle class and
pum ped a lotof dollars into the econom y. ButRoosevelt s N ew D ealprogram m es did not end
the D epression. It w as only w hen w w I started that the renew ed prosperity cam e about, in
the fom of high levels of industrial output and low levels of unem ploym ent.
12. W orld W ar I
In 1939 w hen Britain and France declared w ar on G erm any, the United States issued
form al declaration of neutrality tw o days later. E conom y, stim ulated by defence expenditures
and w ar orders from abroad, had rebounded and in last quarter enpyed sharp increases in
m anufacturing output; unem ploym ent declined to about9.5 m illion.
Throughout 1940 and 1941, the A m erican public engaged in a passionate debate over
w hether the country should intervene in another European w ar. How ever, w ith the fall of
France in 1940, Britain w as left alone under the attack of H itler. The A m ericans began to
fear that if H itler w on the w ar, A m erican interests in Europe and the Pacific w ould be
seriously threatened. In late 1940, Roosevelt called for an all-out effort to increase the
production of w ar m aterials, proposing that the Untied States should becom e .- the great
arsenal of dem ocracy." In early 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease A ct and decisively
breached the non-interventionist principle and he A m erican com m itm ent to the w ar increased
gradually.
A m erica w as finally draw n into w ar by events in the Pacific, w here the govemm ent w as
deeply concemed by Japanese expansionism in China and Southeast A sia. A fter the Japanese
attack of the US naval base at Pearl H arbour in H aw aii on D ecem ber 7, 1941, the U nited
States im m ediately declared w ar and H itler declared w ar on the U nited States. In 1945, the
United States and its allies w on the w ar, achieving the form al surrender of G erm any and
Japan.
During his period, the federal govemm ent invested hugely in its econom y and as a
result, industrial output alm ost doubled, w ith spectacularly high increases in synthetics,
plastics and alloys and light m etals. The w ar accelerated the east-to-w est, south-to-north.
and country-to-city m ovem ents of the population. Technology got an enom ous boost, w ith
research and developm ent piling up im portant gains in electronics, rocketry, jet engines,
w onder drugs and atom ic pow er. The w ar ended w ith he United States as the greatesi
econom ic and m ilitary pow er on the planet, indeed in hum an history, and it w as from that
term hat the w ord "superpow er" entered he language as the only term adequate to express
its suprem acy.
13. The Cold W ar
The A m erican foreign policy since 1945 has been dom inated by a set of assum ptions,
perceptions and actions that m ay be best sum m ed up in the term " anti-com m unist'. Shortly
after the peace, U S politics cam e to be dom inated by a profound sense of fear about extemal
aggression and intemal subversion. This w as partly a response to dom estic political conflicts
and the unresolved debates of the N ew D eal, w orsened by the upsurge of labour unrest The
other w as due to the consolidation of com m unist rule in the countries of E astem Europe as
w ell as the distrust betw een the United States and the Soviet Union w ith the likelihood of a
nuclear w ar.
In 1949 the U. S. form ed he N orth A tlantic Treaty 0 rganization (N A T0 ). This evoked
in the Soviet U nion the response of organizing the eastem European countries into the W arsaw
Pact, a m utual defence alliance also. D istrust betw een the US and the U SSR blossom ed into
a cold w ar. In 1950 a w ar broke out betw een N orth K orea and South K orea, w hen the U nited
States sent its m ilitary forces under the nam e of the U N am y to fight the com m unist N orth as
a " police action". Shortly after the K orean W ar, the United S tates started its involvem ent in
V ietnam to help the Southem govemm ent to fight against the com m unist in the N orh. N one
of the tw o w ars w ere declared by the Congress, so the debate over the latter divided the
A m erican electorate and spurred congressional efforts to lim it the ability of the president to
com m it to arm ed com bat. D em onstrations protesting A m erican involvem ent in the V ietnam
W ar broke out on college cam puses across the U nited S tates. There w ere som e violent clashes
betw een students and police. It w as not until 1973 that a peace treaty w as signed betw een
A m erica and N orth V ietnam .
14. Prosp erity and the C ivil R igh ts M ovem ent
From 1945 until 1970, the United States enjyed a long period of econom ic grow th,
interrupted only by brief and fairly m ild recessions. For the first tim e, the great m aprity of
A m ericans could enjby a com fortable standard of living. By 1960, 55 percent of all
households ow ned w ashing m achines, 77 percent ow ned cars, 90 percent had television sets
and nearly all had refrigerators.
A t the sam e tim e, the United States w ere m oving slow ly in the direction of racial
jstice. In 1954, in the decision Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the
Suprem e Court unanim ously ruled that segregation in the public schools w as unconstitutional;
nevertheless, southem states continued to resist integration after the decision. In 1955, Rosa
Parks refused to m ove from her seat for the w hites on a M ontgom ery bus,  thus started the
A frican A m erican's boycott leading to the era of C ivil R ights protests. For the next decade,
Dr. M artin Luther K ing, Jr. headed the dem onstrations and m arches against unjust law s,
w hich grew into the fam ous m assive M arch on W ashington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.
The effort resulted in the C ivil R ights A ct of 1964, the m ost far-reaching bill on civil rights.
w hich forbade discrim ination on the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, and national
origin. The V oting R ights A ct of 1965 finally enabled all black A m ericans to vote.
Follow ing the exam ple of blacks, other m inorities - H ispanics, A sians, A m erican
Indians dem anded a broadening of their rights. D iscrim ination in im m igration w as ended in
this period. N ational origins quotas w ere abolished, allow ing a great increase in entry visas
for A sians. W om en's status since W orld W ar II also had been changed enorm ously. In the
1970s a w om en's liberation m ovem ent pressed for legal abortion, day-care centres, equal pay
and pbs for w om en.
A nother m ajr pattem of the period has been the explosive grow th in the com m unications
m edia, particularly in data processing, xerography, and television. It w as also a tim e w hen
A m ericans burst out of the greatest physical constraint of all and started to probe into the
un iv erse.
15. Am erica at the End of the Tw entieth C en tury
For he last quarter of the tw entieth century, A m erica underw ent the W atergate Scandal.
the Iranian hostage crisis, the Cold W ar fears from the Soviet invasion of A fghanistan, and
the reversion of the Panam a C anal
In the 1980 election, President Carter w as defeated by Republican contender Ronald
R eagan, and the R epublican party also m ade im pressive gains in both houses of Congress. In
foreign policy, Reagan pledged to assist m ilitant anticom m unist forces in any Soviet
dom inated country. D om estically , there w as greater hostility to govemm ent intervention and
social w elfare, m ore sym pathy for the concems of the religious right, and deeper
com m itm ent to the defence and aerospace industries. There w as a m assive build-up of
Am erican forces as w ell as a program m e of m odemization and revitalization, w ith the
increasing defence budget being financed by m eans of deficit spending. This m oney alsc
bought a new generation of nuclear m issiles and w eapons that w ere intended for fighting a
nuclear w ar.
T he decade of 1980s w as a period of fundam ental change in A m erican political.
social and cultural life. T he sense that the R eagan years represented an im portant divide
in the A m erican experience is reinforced by the intemational upheaval of the end of the
Cold W ar, w hich began during his second tem and w as carried through during the Bush
presidency. w hile R eaganism w as identified w ith conservative social and m oral values,
and m ore specifically w ith the revival of religion, the key econom ic developm ents of the
R eagan years -- the deregulation of business and the astonishingly sw ift introduction of
infom ation technology --- w ere nothing short of revolutionary in their effects. A fter the
R eagan boom in the m id-1980s, the stock m arket crash of 1987 exposed vulnerabilities
in the A m erican econom y, and the United S tates becam e a net debtor after over60 years
as a creditor.

1. The D eclaration ofIndependence
w hen in the course of hum an events, it becom es necessary for one people to dissolve the
political bands w hich have connected them w ith another, and to assum e the Pow ers of the
earth, the separate and equal station to w hich the L aw s of N ature and of N ature's G od entitle
them , a decent respect to the opinions of m ankind requires that they should declare the causes
w hich im pel them to the separation.
W e hold these tuths to be self-evident, that all m en are created equal, that they are
endow ed by their Creator w ith certain unalienable rights, that am ong these are L ife, L iberty 
and the pursuit of H appiness. That to secure these rights, G ovemm ents are instituted am ong
M en, deriving their jst pow ers from the consent of the govemed. That w henever any Form
of G ovemm ent becom es destructive of these ends, it is the R ight of the People to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new G ovemm ent, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its pow ers in such fom , as to them shall seem m ost likely to effect their Safety
and H appiness. Prudence, indeed, w ill dictate that G ovemm ents long established should
not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath show n j
that m ankind are m ore disposed to suffer, w hile evils are sufferable, than to right
them selves by abolishing the form s to w hich they are accustom ed. But w hen a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the sam e O bject evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
G overnm ent, and to provide new G uards for their future security. -- Such has been the
patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity w hich constrains them to
alter their fom er System s of G ovemm ent The history of he present K ing of G reat Britain

H e has excited dom estic insurrections am ongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the

In every stage of these Oppressions W e have Petitioned for Redress in the m ost hum ble

3. The A m biguous A m erican
by H enry Steele C om m ager
Few 0 ld W orld countries have been preoccupied w ith the search for national identity;
because they are the products of history, w ith their ow n language, culture and traditions,
they can take their character for granted. A m ericans have never been able to take hem selves
for granted in this com fortable fashion. They have been conscious -- perhaps they are still
conscious -- that they w ere a new nation, and one m ade out of the m ost m iscellaneous
m aterials, their language, their law s, their culture inherited from the O ld W orld
A t the sam e tim e they have, from the beginning, been sure that their nation did have a
character of its ow n, a special character and a special destiny. Franklin noted distinctly
" A m erican traits" even before independence, and m ost of the Founding Fathers w ere
determ ined that the new nation should differ profoundly from the nations of the O ld w orld.
From St John Crevecoeur and Condorcet to Tocqueville and Grattan, from Bryce and
M unsterberg to Brogan and M yrdal, foreign observers drew confidently the lineam ents of
" that new m an, the A m erican. "
W e have then im pressive authority for asserting that there are indeed A m erican traits. To
enum erate such traits does not in any w ay im ply hat they are unique to the A m ericans: m ost
W estem peoples, after all, share a com m on character. N or does it im ply that all A m ericans
reveal these traits. A m ericans are a heterogeneous and individualistic people. A nd it w ould
certainly be an error to suppose that such traits as w e m ay assign to the A m erican are in any
sense inherent They are, rather, the product of environm ent and experience; both of these
have changed and continue to change.
Let us see if w e can distinguish som e com m on denom inators in the A m erican character.
(1) Perhaps the m ost com m on, and the m ost pervasive, is carelessness. The A m erican
is careless in his m anners, his dress and his address: he is careless about his house and his
garden; careless in social relationships, shuffling off old and taking on new w ith utm ost
casualness; careless about observing law s, rules and regulations; careless about his food and
his drink, and im patient w ith cerem ony ; careless about m oney.
He tends to be careless about larger things as w ell: his social relationships, his
educational system and his politics. H e has a long tradition of carelessness tow ard nature. H e
used up the soil, bumed dow n the forests, polluted the stream s, killed off the buffalo and the
pigeons; he tums nature into a desert and his cities into junkyards.
(2) The A m erican is, on the w hole, open-handed, generous and hospitable. N o other
people pours so m uch m oney into churches, schools, hospitals and other charities; no other
has given so freely to help less fortunate people around the globe. W hile it is true that a
system of tax exem ptions m akes it easy for A m ericans to be generous, it is suggestive that
A m erican tax law s are designed to encourage giving. The great philanthropic foundation is a
distinctly A m erican institution, alm ost an A m erican invention.
(3) M uch of A m erican generosity springs from good fortune and abundance. These
account, too, for a third A m erican trait: self-indulgence. The A m erican dearly loves com fort
and is acquiring a taste for luxury. H e pam pers him self, his w ife and his children. H e rides
instead of w alking ; overheats his house, his office and even his car; thinks him self entitled to
frequent and long vacations,  to sum m ers in the North W oods and w inters in Florida. He
spends enough on tobacco, liquors and cosm etics to pay off he national debt; drives his
children to school instead of letting them w alk or ride bicycles; m arries young and takes for
granted help from his parents.
The D eclaration of Independence included the pursuit of happiness as a naturalright, and
the A m erican is obsessed w ith this pursuit H e is sure thatprovidence and nature m ean him to
be happy and he regards any interference w ith the attainm ent of happiness as a violation of
natural law . A dvertisem ents proclaim this m ore blatantly in A m erica than elsew here. W hat is
achieved by the cigarette, the vacation in Florida, the electric m ixer, the new car, is
happ iness.
(4) This expectation of happiness bespeaks a strong strain of sentim entality and even
rom anticism . The A m erican is sentim ental about m any things: children, the little red
schoohouse, the " old" South, nature, college, w ar and sports. W here else do m en and
w om en rise and uncover as they solem nly intone the A Im a M ater at som e athletic event;
w here else, for that m atter, do they have college songs?
A m erican advertisem ents ooze sentim ent; A m erican m ovies and television purvey it
relentlessly - along w ith a good deal of quite unsentim ental sadism , to be sure. If novels are
not so sentim ental as they w ere in the 19h century, the stories that trickle hrough the
advertisem ents in w om en' s m agazines still are.
(5) 0ne of the m ore am iable of A m erican traits is gregariousness. It is doubtless a
product of N ew W orld circum stances, of a society that has been atom ized and is anxious to
knit new ties of association to take the place of the old; of a frontier environm ent w here m en
banded together to conquer nature and isolation; of equalitarianism , w hich looked w ith
suspicion on anyone w ho held aloof from his fellow m en.
A m ericans like to do things together and take com fort in num bers. They are the w orld's
m ost enthusiastic biners; they do notw ant to read alone or w alk alone, but bin clubs so they
can do these things in com m on. They do not prize privacy, but com pany, and they subm it
cheerfully to continuous invasions of privacy - m usic blaring at them in train and plane,
com m ercials shouting at them over radio and television, the badges w om so conspicuously at
every convention.
The A m erican tends to distrust the m an w ho lives to him self, w ho prefers reading to
conversation on a bus or a plane, w ho does not bin fratemities or clubs and w ho hesitates to
use first nam es.
(6) 0 n one A m erican trait alm ost all European critics are agreed: m aterialism . Is the
A m erican in fact m ore m aterialistic han his European cousins? Perhaps he is m erely m ore
honest H e is intensely conscious of the m aterial w orld in w hich he lives, the w orld of natural
abundance, he w orld of industry and business. He is conscious, too, of size and space.
A Im ost tw o centuries ago Crevecoeur observed that the overw helm ing im pact of size and
environm ent at once enlarged and elevated the ideas of the A m erican; a hundred m iles, he
said, w ere now w hat a m ile had been before.
The United States w as, at birh, the largest of W estem nations, and for over a century.
the A m erican im agination w as fired by the prospect of " land enough for our descendants to
the thousandth and thousandth generation," by vast m ountain ranges, lim itless prairies, lakes
as large as oceans. N or should it be forgotten that, if the " land w as ours before w e w ere the
land's," the process of becom ing A m erican w as in part one of identification w ith the natural
environm ent
H istory, too, em phasized m aterial considerations; if the new nation w as to preserve its
independence in a hostile w orld and realize its dem ocratic potential, it had to grow , and grow
fast
N o w onder the A m erican has alw ays been fascinated by size and figures. N o w onder he
takes pride in the largest lakes, the tallest trees, the m ost rapidly grow ing cities.
(7) The A m erican is confident and self-confident; he is, generally, a yes-sayer to life
H e thinks that he is on top of the w orld and that everything is going his w ay; challenges and
disturbances w hich point to opposite conclusions he generally considers as aberrations, jst as
he regards defeat (or even a draw ) in w aror diplom acy contrary to providence and to nature.
H e has confidence in him self, in his school, his lodge, his business: confidence, too.
in the good w ill of that providence, w hich, in the prophetic w ords of Jefferson, "by all its
dispensations proves that it delights in his happiness here and his greater happiness
hereafter. " If the A m erican has som ew hat less confidence now in providence, he has perhaps
m ore in h m sef
(8) Self-confidence m elts easily into com placency and this into arrogance, and the
A m erican has rather m ore than his share of both. H e believes that his country has reached the
pinnacle of civilization and that the " A m erican w ay of life" is a m oral rather than m erely a
social condition. The A m erican constantly asserts that he enjys the highest standard of
living, though he Scandinavian countries and C anada have a higher; that his m edicine is the
best in he w orld, though his country is ll th in infant m ortality; that his fom of govemm ent
is indubitably the best, though not one of the som e 50 new nations has seen fit to copy it
This attitude expresses a deeper trait: the habit of supposing that the A m ericans are a
peculiar people: that they are, som ehow , exem pt from the norm al lim itations of history. The
A m erican congratulates him self on his equalitarianism even w hile he excludes one-tenth of the
people from benefits of equality. H e believes that there is greater liberty here than elsew here
and regards M cC arthy or the B irch Society as aberrations.
If there are em barrassing chapters in his history, he ignores hem . O ther nations are
im perialistic, but not the A m erican: ousting the Indian, the Spaniard and the M exican
som ehow doesn't count O her nations are m ilitaristic but not the U nited States, even though
it engaged in half a doze m abr w ars and, during the 19 th century, alm ost continuous Indian
W S
(9) The United States is perhaps the country w here the com petitive spirit is m ost
cultivated and adm ired. Cultural anthropologists assure us that A m erican children com pete
fiercely for parental love, and w e do not need anthropologists to rem and us of the ardent
com petition for " dates" that begins even in the elem entary school and carries on through
college years. W here else do colleges and universities com pete so fiercely in athletics; w here
else does business engage in such cut-throat com petition?
Com petition is indeed part of that m ysterious hing, " the A m erican w ay of life. " The
explanation, again, is to be found in large part in our history. In a sense the A m erican has
for generations been com peting w ith the rest of the w orld, com peting for population, for
culture, for pow er. In a sense every new com er -- and w e have had som e 40 m illion of them
over the past century and a half-- is engaged in proving that he did the right thing, and that
life in A m erica is better than life in the O ld W orld.
Equalitarianism , too, im posed com petition on its beneficiaries. W here a m an's social
and econom ic position w as fixed -- as it w as in the O Id W orld -- there w as little point in
m aking an effort to im prove it But the new w orld, w here it was possible to go from log
cabin to W hite H ouse, and from rags to riches, and w here careers and social position w ere
open to talent, put a prem ium on com petition.
(10) A s the A m erican disregarded the artificial barriers of rank and class, so he
disregarded w hat he thought the artificial restrictions of the law . H e revered law w ith a capital
L, he revered the Constitution, from tim e to tim e he even revered the Suprem e Court, but
that w as about as far as his reverence w ent
H is custom ary attitude tow ard law s, rules and regulations w as one of indifference or
exasperation. The circum stances of life in the N ew W orld encouraged this attitude. Colonials
saw no reason w hy they should respect land law s or trade law s or law s regulating Indian
affairs hat w ere enacted in London and thought them selves justified in taking " law " into their
ow n hands.
A fter independence the sam e cavalier attitude obtained on successive frontiers. Now it
w as the G ovemm ent in W ashington w hose law s affronted the frontiersm an, or the land
speculator, or the m iner, or the trader, and he saw no reason w hy he should abide by them .
The habit persisted and spread. Southemers w ho thought a victorious N orth had foisted the
14 th and 15 th am endm ents on them , saw no reason w hy they should be bound by them , and
ignored them , as they still do. The average A m erican is law less in sm all m atters as in big -
thus the universal disregard of parking regulations in our cities: thus all but universal flouting
of traffic law s w hose m onum ent is 40 ,000 deaths every year.
I have left to the last tw o of he m ore fam iliar A m erican traits: equalitarianism and
resourcefulness. W hat Tocqueville argued so perspicaciously in the eighteen-thirties -- that
equality w as the m ost pervasive of all A m erican traits - still holds for the nineteen-sixties.
Notw ithstanding the m assive denial of equality to the N egr, and to other colored peoples as
w ell, equality is still the greatest com m on denom inator of the A m erican character. E quality
obtains in schools and colleges. in business and in politics, in the church and even in the
m ilitary. There are class distinctions, to be sure, but they are tem porary and fluctuating,
w hile the principle of equality is perm anent and pervasive.
Finally, the A m erican is resourceful H e leamed early that he m ust be, if he w ere to
survive and flourish in a w orld that w as new , strange and filled w ith danger. H e early proved
resourceful in practical m atters, in developing the right kind of ax, the right kind of plow ,
the right kind of steam boat, the right kind of fencing.
Indeed, if there is an A m erican philosophy, it is pragm atism , w hich looks to conduct.
function, processes. The Am erican w ants to get on w ith the jb: he w ants to know how a
m achine or an institution or an idea w orks and he is inclined to define these in tem s of their
conduct. Even in religion the A m erican is m ore interested in good w orks than in theology or
dogm a. He invented the case system for the study of law and the problem m ethod for the
study of alm ost every thing else.
H e is infatuated w ith com m on sense, and thinks all problem s w ill yield to a com m on-
sense solution. w hen he invests tim e or m oney or sentim ent he w ants result, and he likes
results that are m aterial and concrete. H e has a naive faith in his ability to achieve his ends
through practical and even m echanical m eans, and thinks that he can becom e an orator, a
m usician, an executive or a perfect lover by excelling in som e appropriate course.
M ost im portant of all the A m erican revealed, and still reveals, resourcefulness in his
attitude tow ard experim entation and change. Change is difficult for any society, but less
difficult, perhaps, for the A m erican than for others. A m erica, after all, originated in change
and the habit of taking change for granted w as one he acquired m ost readily.
0 n all but one occasion in the past A m ericans have carried through fundam ental changes
by the process of evolution rather than of revolution. W e m ay w ith som e confidence assum e
that this deeply engrained habit w ill persist.
4. First InauguralA ddress of Franklin D. R oosevelt
I am certain that m y fellow A m ericans expect that on m y induction into the Presidency I
w ill address them w ith a candor and a decision w hich the present situation of our Nation
im pels. This is preem inently the tim e to speak the truth, the w hole truth, frankly and boldly.
N or need w e shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great N ation
w ill endure as it has endured, w ill revive and w ill prosper. So, first of all, let m e assert m y
firm belief that the only thing w e have to fear is fear itself - nam eless, unreasoning.
un justified terror w hich paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark
hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has m et w ith that understanding
and support of the people them selves w hich is essential to victory. I am convinced that you
w ill again give that support to leadership in these critical days.
In such a spirit on m y part and on yours w e face our com m on difficulties. They
concem, thank G od, only m aterial things. V alues have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes
have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; govemm ent of all kinds is faced by serious
curtailm ent of incom e; the m eans of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the
w ithered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; fam ers find no m arkets for their
produce; the savings of m any years in thousands of fam ilies are gone.
M ore im portant, a host of unem ployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and
an equally great num ber toil w ith little retum. Only a foolish optim ist can deny the dark
realities of the m om ent.
Y et our distress com es from no failure of substance. W e are stricken by no plague of
locusts. C om pared w ith the perils w hich our forefathers conquered because they believed and
w ere not afraid, w e have still m uch to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and
hum an efforts have m ultiplied it P lenty is atour doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes
in the very sight of the supply. Prim arily this is because the rulers of the exchange of
m ankind's goods have failed, through their ow n stubbomness and their ow n incom petence,
have adm itted their failure, and abdicated. Practices of he unscrupulous m oney changers
stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and m inds of m en.
True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattem of an outw om
tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of m ore m oney.
Stripped of the lure of profit by w hich to induce our people to follow their false leadership,
they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know
only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and w hen there is no
vision the people perish.
The m oney changers have fled from their high seats in the tem ple of our civilization. W e
m ay now restore that tem ple to the ancient truths. The m easure of the restoration lies in the
ex tent to w hich w e apply social values m ore noble than m ere m onetary profit
H appiness lies not in the m ere possession of m oney ; it lies in he by of achievem ent, in
the thrill of creative effort. The py and m oral stim ulation of w ork no longer m ust be
forgotten in the m ad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days w ill be w orth all they cost
us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be m inistered unto but to m inister to
ourselves and to our fellow m en.
R ecognition of the falsity of m aterial w ealth as he standard of success goes hand in hand
w ith the abandonm ent of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be
valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit: and there m ust be an end
to a conduct in banking and in business w hich too often has given to a sacred trust the
likeness of callous and selfish w rongdoing. Sm all w onder hat confidence languishes, for it
hrives only on honesty, on honor, on he sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection,
on unselfish perform ance; w ithout them it cannot live.
R estoration calls, how ever, not for changes in ethics alone. This N ation asks for action.
and action now .
O ur greatest prim ary task is to put people to w ork. This is no unsolvable problem if w e
face it w isely and courageously. It can be accom plished in part by direct recruiting by the
G ovemm ent itself, treating the task as w e w ould treat the em ergency of a w ar, but at the
sam e tim e, through this em ploym ent, accom plishing greatly needed projects to stim ulate and
reorganize the use of our natural resources.
H and in hand w ith this w e m ust frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our
industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to
provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by
definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and w ith this the pow er to purchase
he output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the grow ing
loss through foreclosure of our sm all hom es and our farm s. It can be helped by insistence that
the federal, state, and local govemm ents act forthw ith on the dem and that their cost be
drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities w hich today are often
scattered, uneconom ical, and unequal It can be helped by national planning for and
supervision of all fom s of transportation and of com m unications and other utilities w hich
have a definitely public character. There are m any w ays in w hich it can be helped, but it can
never be helped m erely by taking about it W e m ust act and act quickly.
Finally, in our progress tow ard a resum ption of w ork w e require tw o safeguards against
a retum of the evils of the old order: there m ust be a strict supervision of all banking and
credits and investm ents; here m ust be an end to speculation w ith other people's m oney , and
there m ust be provision for an adequate but sound currency.
There are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special
session detailed m easures for their fulfillm ent, and I shall seek the im m ediate assistance of the
Sev eral S ta tes.
Through this program of action w e address ourselves to putting our ow n national house
in order and m aking incom e balance outgo. O ur intemational trade relations, though vastly
im portant, are in point of tim e and necessity secondary to the establishm ent of a sound
national econom y. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first I shall spare no
effort to restore w orld trade by intemational econom ic readjustm ent, but the em ergency at
hom e cannot w ait on that accom plishm ent
The basic hought that guides these specific m eans of national recovery is not narrow ly
nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the
various elem ents in all parts of the U nited States -- a recognition of the old and perm anently
im portant m anifestation of the A m erican spirit of the pioneer. It is the w ay to recovery. It is
the im m ediate w ay. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery w ill endure.
In the field of w orld policy I w ould dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good
neighbor - the neighbor w ho resolutely respects him self and, because he does so, respects
the rights of others -- the neighbor w ho respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of
his agreem ents in and w ith a w orld of neighbors.
If I read the tem per of our people correctly, w e now realize as w e have never realized
before our interdependence on each other: that w e can not m erely take but w e m ust give as
w ell; that if w e are to go forw ard, w e m ust m ove as a trained and loyal am y w illing to
sacrifice for the good of a com m on discipline, because w ithout such discipline no progress is
m ade, no leadership becom es effective. W e are, I know , ready and w illing to subm it our
lives and property to such discipline, because it m akes possible a leadership w hich aim s at a
larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes w ill bind upon us all as
a sacred obligation w ith a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in tim e of am ed strife.
W ith this pledge taken, I assum e unhesitatingly the leadership of this great arm y of our
people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our com m on problem s.
A ction in this im age and to this end is feasible under the form of govemm ent w hich w e
have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so sim ple and practical that it is
possible alw ays to m eet extraordinary needs by changes in em phasis and arrangem ent w ithout
loss of essential fom . That is w hy our constitutional system has proved itself the m ost
superbly enduring political m echanism the m odem w orld has produced. It has m et every
stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign w ars, of bitter intemal strife, of w orld
relations.
It is to be hoped that the nom al balance of executive and legislative authority m ay be
w holly adequate to m eet the unprecedented task before us. But it m ay be that an
unprecedented dem and and need for undelayed action m ay call for tem porary departure from
that nom al balance of public procedure.
I am prepared under m y constitutional duty to recom m end the m easures that a stricken
nation in the m idst of a stricken w orld m ay require. These m easures, or such other m easures
as the Congress m ay build out of its experience and w isdom , I shall seek, w ithin m y
constitutional au thority, to bring to speedy adop tion.
But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these tw o courses, and in the
event that the national em ergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty
that w ill then confront m e. I shall ask he Congress for the one rem aining instrum ent to m eet
the crisis  broad Executive pow er to w age a w ar against the em ergency, as great as the
pow er that w ould be given to m e if w e w ere in fact invaded by a foreign foe.
For the trust reposed in m e I w ill retum the courage and the devotion that befit the tim e.
I can do no 1ess.
W e face the arduous days that lie before us in the w am courage of the national unity ;
w ith the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious m oral values; w ith the clean
satisfaction that com es from the stem perfom ance of duty by old and young alike. W e aim at
the assurance of a rounded and perm anent national life.
W e do not distrust the future of essential dem ocracy. The people of the U nited States
have not failed. In their need they have registered a m andate that they w ant direct, vigorous
action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have m ade m e
the present instrum ent of their w ishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.
In this dedication of a Nation w e hum bly ask the blessing of G od. M ay H e protect each
and every one of us. M ay H e guide m e in the days to com e.
